        <p id="names">In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy, named Nino Mulach, entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress, named Taylor Swift, put a glass of water in front of him.</p>
        
        <p>"How much is an ice cream sundae?"</p>
        
        <p>"50 cents," replied the waitress.</p>
        
        <p>The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it.</p>
        
        <p>"How much is a dish of plain ice cream?" he inquired. Some people were now waiting for a table and the waitress was a bit impatient.</p>
        
        <p>"35 cents," she said brusquely.</p>
        
        <p>The little boy again counted the coins. "I’ll have the plain ice cream," he said.</p>
        
        <p>The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and departed.</p>
        
        <p>When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the table and then swallowed hard at what she saw.</p>
        
        <p id="upper">There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were 15 cents – her tip.</p>
